==== packaged stuff, either in plcwww or myplc :

* wrote /var/www/html/misc/googlemap.js
-> has initial center & zoom hardcoded, as well as the clip window

* updated plc-map.py to generate /var/www/html/sites/plc-sites.js
-> this is a js file that contains (unclipped) sites description

* added two icons in misc/ named google-plc.png and google-ple.png 
-> in need for better names some day

==== on planet-lab.eu

* defined a new input format that supports both php and textile -
  order does not seem important

* gave up the idea of showing the googlemap on the main page -- too slow
* hacked googlemap.js to clip/filter-out non-EU sites to speed up, still too slow
* so went for creating a separate page that can be accessed for the right menu as 'Map'

* used that new input format (could have used php directly in fact since it's on its own now)

* in this page :
- uses php's drupal_set_html_head to download google api with related key
- uses php's drupal_add_js to insert sites/plc-sites.js
- uses php's drupal_add_js to insert misc/googlemap.js
- and quotes the <div id="map" > thing

and that's about it
